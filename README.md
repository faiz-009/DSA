Today I am starting my DSA journey and I am going to record everything that I am going to do everyday. My goal is to secure a handsome placement in a big MNC with a pakage of more than 10 LPA and for that I have to work hard and consistently. 
Goal for the next 1 month:-
1. complete 20 questions of array and string
2. complete desktop assistant project

Goal for the next 6 months:-
1. Solve more than 400+ problems on DSA
2. build 2-3 projects for resume
3. believe in yourself
